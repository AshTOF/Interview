# Problem Statement

The initial task consists of a single, poorly defined, objective; provided below.
You are required to talk through your thought processes on how you would address the unknowns, what implementations you would consider, and why. 
The use of pseudocode or a diagraming tool (such as excalidraw/paint) is recommended.

## Assumptions

You may make a few assumptions in the course of this task:
- There is no pre-existing tech stack - you may use whatever languages, frameworks etc you are comfortable with.
- Your interviewer will play "every other character": Product Owner, BA, Delivery Manager, another engineer, etc...
- Unless otherwise stated any existing third party has already been integrated with and anything they would provide can be assumed to "just work".

## Your Objective

You are tasked with designing a system that will provide weather details for a given postcode. 

Please talk though the steps you would take to achieve this, and what considerations would you make? 

## Points to Consider

- What's the simplest approach you could implement, based on your current understanding?
- How would your design handle evolving requirements? Is it extensible?
- How would you ensure the health of your system?
- How would your system react to an ever-increasing number of users? What about burst traffic?
